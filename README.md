# LunarLander
The lunar lander, a specialized spacecraft, aims for a safe and controlled touchdown on the moon's surface. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful machine learning technique where an agent learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties as feedback. Recently, RL has gained traction in training autonomous lunar landers. This technology has the potential to develop sophisticated control systems that can navigate the moon's challenging and unpredictable terrain, ensuring the safety of the spacecraft and any crew onboard.
Applying RL for lunar lander control presents unique challenges. The lunar surface features diverse terrain, a significantly weaker gravitational pull compared to Earth, and a complete absence of atmospheric pressure. These factors can significantly impact the spacecraft's movement and control, requiring robust algorithms to handle these complexities.

Developing a robust and efficient RL agent that can learn to control the lunar lander in a challenging environment with limited information and actions available. The agent needs to navigate the lander to minimize fuel consumption while ensuring a safe and soft landing within the designated area.
The OpenAI Gym's Lunar Lander environment offers a well-defined physics engine, mimicking a real-world scenario where a lunar lander needs a precise touchdown on the moon's surface under low gravity conditions. This setting serves as a valuable platform to explore how reinforcement learning techniques can be applied to solve control problems.
The primary objective of the game is to manoeuvre the agent as softly and fuel-efficiently as possible towards the landing site. The action space is discrete, while the state space is continuous, much like in real physics.
